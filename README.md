# PasswordValidator
This is a password validator that validates the types of characters used within the password as well
as the minimum and maximum number of each character.

## Usage
You simply input one or many passwords in the validator and it tells you 
if the password meets all of the requirements needed. If the password does not 
meet one or many of the requirements it will display the error and append
it to a file.
